For example, Tremere use hermetic sigils, while Banu Haqim use gematria. When the trespasser touches the warded object, a supernatural force of energy that feels much like an electric shock burns through the trespasser''s body. Wielding warded items and striking trespassers does not trigger the effects of the ward. Similarly, Attacking or using a Combat Maneuver against someone who has warded armor does not trigger the ward. However, if the trespasser were to disarm a combatant of a warded sword, then tried to pick it up, this would trigger the ward.</p><p>Wards can only cover objects no larger than three square feet or an area that would take only one step to cross. You could not ward an entire door, for example, but you could ward the door handle. The caster pours one Rouse check worth of blood, mixed with any required ingredients, on the object and traces the glyph with her bare finger. Once the casting time is complete, she may wipe away the Blood, rendering the ward invisible to mundane senses. Sense the Unseen can detect a ward if the Auspex user wins a contest challenge using her Wits + Awareness vs. the Ritual caster’s Intelligence + Occult. The ward lasts until the object is physically destroyed. Most objects that are warded only have one Structure, but particularly rugged items may have more. A character may only maintain a number of wards equal to twice her dots in the Occult Skill. If she creates a new ward in excess of her limit, the first (chronologically) ward she created ceases to function permanently.</p><p>When a trespasser touches a ward (gloves or other garments offer no protection), she immediately takes one point of Aggravated Damage and must immediately release the object unless she activates a power such as Uncanny Grip, which protects her from being disarmed. She must then make a test to avoid Terror Frenzy, with a difficulty equal to the caster’s dots in the Occult Skill. Further attempts by the trespasser to touch the object require a Stamina + Resolve (difficulty 5) challenge before being able to. Successful contact again causes one Aggravated Damage, but does not risk sending the trespasser into a Terror Frenzy. If the trespasser is a creature that does not normally Frenzy, she still makes this test and, if they fail, must flee, directly away from the warded object for five minutes.</p>\"}","{\"label\":\"Warding Circles\",\"text\":\"<p>Warding circles are similar to wards but are much larger and are painted on the ground or floor. Trespassers who attempt to cross the boundary of a warding circle suffer the same effects as if they had touched a warded object. Instead of letting go of the warded object, they instead cease their movement at the warding circle''s boundary. Should the trespasser wish, and presuming she has not succumbed to a Terror Frenzy, she may attempt to cross the boundary again by making a successful Stamina + Resolve (difficulty 7). Each subsequent attempt to cross the boundary (successful or not) of a warding circle results in one point of Aggravated Damage but does not cause the trespasser to risk Frenzy. Once inside a warding circle, leaving its boundaries causes no ill effect.</p><p>A ritualist may choose to inscribe a warding circle pointing inward around a trespasser (who has likely been incapacitated prior to the casting of the warding circle). In this case entering into the circle causes no ill effect but any trespassers trying to leave the circle suffer the effects of the ward.</p><p><strong>Warding circles differ from wards in the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li>A warding circle requires three Rouse checks to cast.

Warding circles cast indoors extend from floor to ceiling. Warding circles cast outdoors extend from ground level to 18 feet (six steps of movement).</li>        <li>A warding circle exists only on the plane of existence it was cast in. However, creatures attempting to circumnavigate a warding circle by crossing into (or out of) it from one realm are blocked in the same way as if they had encountered the border of the warding circle. In addition to the normal costs, creatures must repay any cost to cross the boundary between worlds on each subsequent attempt to bypass the warding circle in this way.</li><li>Unlike normal wards, a warding circle can activate with forcible contact.</li><li>Warding circles cost three Rouse checks worth of Blood to paint the necessary sigils and one full night to cast. This does not cost a Downtime Action.</li>  <li>Warding circles last for a year and a day after casting. Once in place, nothing short of complete removal of all solid material 18 feet below the surface of the warding circle will end a warding circle early.</li>        <li>A character may only maintain a number of warding circles equal to her Occult Skill.

<p>Spend a standard action, make one Rouse check, and touch an object. To collect a psychic impression, touch the target with your bare skin. You then enter a shallow trance and glean information from the spiritual residue on the object. You are only marginally aware of your surroundings while using Spirit’s Touch, although a loud noise or jarring physical sensation will break the trance in an instant. Spirit’s Touch works in the following three ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the object is a corpse, your character receives a vision of the last few moments of the target’s life, including the killer''s face if the victim saw her. If the killer was using supernatural means (such as Mask of a Thousand Faces) to hide their true identity, Spirit’s Touch reveals the fake visage, not the true face.</li>
    <li>If the object is not a corpse, you can determine the last person that handled the object (not including yourself).</li>
    <li>If the object is not a corpse, you can discover the most memorable event concerning the object. This may be its creation, its use in a murder, etc. Merely being present for a memorable event does not reveal anything; the object must have been involved in the event to “remember” it.</li>
</ul>

<p>To discover additional interactions, such as an older handler of an item, or another memorable event, you must succeed in a Intelligence + Investigation challenge vs. a difficulty of 3 while maintaining your hold on the item. These challenges do not cost additional actions or Rouse checks. This difficulty increases by one for each additional interaction trying to be discovered.

The visions received by the use of this power are seldom clear or detailed; they register more like a “psychic snapshot.” They are visual only and lack any sounds, smell, or tactile stimuli. Still, a clever vampire can learn a great deal from a glimpse.</p>

<p>Unlike people, objects do not have a mind that can be fooled by Obfuscate.

<p>While using Possession, your character’s mind is focused entirely on controlling the body she has inhabited. The vampire has no innate sense of anything occurring to her native physical form. The character’s original body falls into a temporary torpor that lasts the duration of the power. If the possessing vampire''s body takes any amount of damage, Possession ends immediately, and the vampire awakens.</p>

<p>While possessing a mortal, the controlling vampire may use any Auspex, Presence, and Dominate powers she knows through the mortal.

<p>Communicating telepathically allows the character and her target to send and receive mental messages and simple images. You may use this mode of Telepathy on any character you have met who is within your local area of play. Line of sight is not required. When communicating with a willing target, a single use of Telepathy lasts for an hour and allows the characters to communicate freely.

Kindred build and are drawn to faiths for myriad reasons. The exertion of power over a flock. Satisfying their Hunger and their Beasts. Elevation of the self. Reassurance of the possibility of redemption. A grand plan they forged or that was bestowed upon them by secret masters.

While some vampire cults span the globe hiding in plain sight, others are fringe faiths with morbid practices and ancient conspiracies lasting centuries. Others such as the incestuous Clan of Death and the malignant Church of Set — arguably the largest vampire cults of all — believe in a destiny that will enable them to impose their wills on the world of the living and the dead.

Whether for power, salvation, or transcendence, all Kindred cults wallow in blood. They shed it in sacrifice, demand it of their followers, and exalt in it in unholy baptisms proclaiming their divine glories.

These cults dedicated to blood gods are among the most insidious, damning sects of Kindred, and tonight they approach their apex of power.

If you refuse to deal with it, it will overcome your mind and drive you to terrible acts to slake it. You walk this razor''s edge every night. Dark designs, bitter enemies, and strange allies await you in this World of Darkness.

Welcome to a blood thriller on the streets of the modern nights. For centuries the Anarch Movement enjoyed an uneasy truce with the Camarilla, but no longer.

Now, the Unbound refuse to bow to the sickening hypocrisy and tyranny of their former allies. Claiming the nighttime streets as their own, the Anarchs seek independence from the despotic Elders, by any means necessary. Only the toughest and smartest of self-made vampires will survive.

  <p>You have got a knack for making friends, and you understand the value in having mortals willing to help you out. These mortals do not know you are a vampire, but they are usually willing to go out on a limb to help you out of a sticky situation or run an errand for you. However, they are only human. They have their own lives that don’t revolve around you. Normally, you may be able to reach an Ally about half the time, at Storyteller discretion; most of that time they will be willing to do the task, although it may be on their own time. Cultivating a balanced relationship with your Allies is important, as they will do more than just make some calls, and they’re far more willing to help you if you help them in return. If an Ally asks a favor of you, you would be smart to act the same way you hope they will act the next time you ask them for help. Each of your Allies may be used once in a game session.</p>
  <p>Each purchase of this Mortal Connection represents one individual Ally, and you may purchase this Mortal Connection multiple times. Work with your Storyteller to develop specific details about your Ally. In a connected chronicle Allies will travel with a character if compensated or if they possess either the Retainer Advantage or the Reliable Advantage at any level.</p>

  <p>You have attracted and made a ghoul of an animal that assists you. You might control it using Animalism or simply good, old-fashioned training. Instead of the variable traits for animals listed in Chapter 10, refer to the statistics below for your Familiar.</p>

    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> The animal is small, like a bird or cat. It has two Health levels, Physical test pools of three, and Mental and Social test pools of one.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> The animal is medium-sized, like a dog or a wolf. It has four Health levels, Physical test pools of five, and Mental and Social test pools of one.</li>

  <p>You may purchase a higher-level companion of a smaller size if you wish. For example, if you want a particularly dangerous dog, you may purchase a level-three dog. When you pick an animal companion, choose Celerity, Potence, or Fortitude. Your Familiar has both level-one powers of that Discipline. A Familiar can never gain more than these two powers.

  <p>Less of a friend and more of a professional connection, Contacts are people you can call when you need information. They are happy to tell you about things going on in their field, trust you enough to share insider knowledge, and don’t often ask for favors in return. However, their assistance is usually limited to information they can gather by making a few phone calls or things they would be doing in their daily jobs anyway. You may use your Contacts to learn about how the mortal world has been influenced within their Sphere(s), or they may call you if they notice something they think may pique your interest.</p>
  <p>Each purchase of this Mortal Connection represents one individual Contact, and you may purchase this Mortal Connection multiple times. Work with your Storyteller to develop details about your Contact. In a connected chronicle it costs 1 downtime to establish similar Contacts in a city outside the one you exist in.</p>

    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> A low-level employee—they do not have much in the way of secret information, but can help you get some general insider knowledge and early-access information.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Someone in middle management—they have access to some information that is kept from the public eye and a fair bit of sway in their field.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Someone in senior management—they have access to a great deal of private, sensitive, or secret information and usually hold an immense amount of influence.</li>

Upon choosing this Mortal Connection, establish exactly how you are famous with your Storyteller and choose a Sphere of Influence in which you have made your name. Characters outside that Sphere may still know you, but recognition is more likely within that Sphere. When encountering someone who knows and likes you, they are more likely to do you a favor or help you out in a pinch, even if they are a complete stranger; you gain a +1 to mundane Social challenges per dot of Fame you possess. Being famous does have its drawbacks though. You are also far more recognizable and memorable when you go places, and not everyone may appreciate you. If you have dots in Mask (see below), your Fame may be associated with either yourself or with your Mask.</p>

  <p>Everyone needs a place to settle down for the day, somewhere safe from Hunters and sunlight. Someone without any dots in Haven lives in complete squalor—they may have carved out a hole in the wall to sleep in, but it has no protections and is terribly uncomfortable. Once you have purchased at least one dot in this Mortal Connection, the Advantages and Disadvantages become available to purchase.</p>
  <p>Vampires may choose to share a Haven with their Allies, especially if they are all in a gang or coterie. For more information on coterie mechanics and sharing Backgrounds, see page 305.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Size 1:</strong> You have a small basement or studio apartment. It is big enough to fit yourself and one other, if you do not mind an utter lack of separated personal space.</li>
    <li><strong>Size 2:</strong> You live in a Haven about the size of a single family home or a nice 3-4 bedroom apartment. You and four others can fit inside comfortably. Gain one free dot of an Advantage to add to your Haven. Requires Resources •.</li>
    <li><strong>Size 3:</strong> Your home is a penthouse-quality apartment, a standalone mansion of a private estate, or even an old bank building you’ve claimed as your own. You and nine others can comfortably enjoy a space of this size. Gain one additional free Advantage dot to add to your Haven (for a total of two free). Requires Resources •••.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Haven Advantages & Disadvantages:</strong> Haven Advantages can be purchased up to three dots, though your dots in any one Haven Advantage cannot exceed your total dots in that Haven’s Size unless stated otherwise.

  <p>Hunting on the streets can be dangerous, and while some vampires like the thrill, others prefer to have a safe, consistent source of food. You have collected a group of humans who are reliable to find, easy to connect with, and susceptible to being fed on regularly without risking a threat to the Masquerade. More often than not, they are unaware of your vampiric nature. During a game session, you may Slake a total number of Hunger equal to your Herd rating. Each time you tap your Herd, you must spend five minutes out of play, regardless of how many Hunger you Slake. You may Slake multiple times during the game using your Herd (up to your limit); however, you still may not reduce your Hunger to zero without killing a victim. This causes the loss of one dot of your Herd (see Losing Mortal Connections, page 142) and at least one Stain (see Shifting Humanity, page 136).</p>
  <p>Be cautious of overfeeding from your Herd. Humans only have so much blood, and if someone dies, it will take some time to regain the rest of your Herd’s trust. In some cases, and at your Storyteller’s discretion, you may need to find a new Herd entirely. If a Herd dot is lost, your character can regain it at a rate of one dot per game, starting the month after the “accident” occurred. Dots in Herd represent both size and variety. You may not purchase the Herd Mortal Connection more than once.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> The blood has a random Resonance (determined each time you utilize your Herd) and no Dyscrasia.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> At the start of each month, you may select one Resonance that your Herd possesses for that month. The blood you drink also has a random Dyscrasia, selected from your chosen Resonance category (see page 129).</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> At the start of each month, select two Resonances that your Herd possesses for that month. Each time you feed, you may choose to ingest either of the two Resonance types. When you do, the Storyteller will offer you two random Dyscrasias corresponding to the ingested Resonance types, and you must choose one to keep.</li>

  <p>In the time of the Second Inquisition, getting by in the mortal world and “passing” as human is more important than ever. A Mask is what a vampire “wears” to blend into mortal society. It is the night job he pretends to have, the pen or stage name he gives, etc. The better a Mask is, the better it explains a character’s nocturnal habits and the more opportunities it provides to get close to humans. Many times a Mask involves forged documents; sometimes it involves makeup and solid acting skills. Vampires can have multiple Masks that suit different situations. However, a vampire without any dots in the Mask Mortal Connection cannot pass a background check and is easily flagged when interacting with authorities.</p>
  <p>When you purchase dots in Mask, think of a pseudonym and a few short sentences to summarize your fake identity. This could include your profession (and why it’s a night time job), place of birth, education, names of fake relatives, etc. Most Masks are meant to be unremarkable and forgettable; however, some Predator types enjoy a more recognizable Mask, one that hides their true identity under a more famous false identity. A Mask cannot make you someone who already exists. You cannot use a Mask to impersonate another character, player or non-player.</p>
  <p>Mask cannot be purchased after character creation unless a character with the Cobbler Merit (page 179) makes them a Mask. Once complete, the receiving character may spend the necessary XP to cement the Mask and apply it to their sheet.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Your Mask will pass a routine inspection; you have an identity and a disguise that is believable and works well enough without close scrutiny.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Your Mask is strong enough to pass a state-level background check or a run through the local police database.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Your Mask will pass an intense background check, even a deep investigation from a national government agent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In some cases, you may wish to abandon your Mask. Perhaps your Mask was arrested; you had to escape to avoid perishing in the sun, and now that identity is too difficult to maintain. Perhaps you were shot and had to play dead when you were portraying your Mask. In this case, you temporarily lose your Mask dots. You regain your dots in Mask when you find a Cobbler to make you a new one.</p>

  <p>Money cannot buy happiness, but it can buy comfort, equipment, and help. With no dots in Resources, you’re in the lower-middle class: able to afford minor luxuries like a small apartment and a car that consistently sputters to life, with about $300 per month that is not budgeted towards rent or necessities. By purchasing dots of Resources, you’ve learned that money really does make the world go around. You may use Resources in game or during Downtime Actions—to purchase weapons, commission armor, rent a hotel on a trip, pay a security detail to pretend you never crossed their paths, bribe politicians . . . The more you have, the more you can do. You may not buy the Resources Mortal Connection more than once. Each level of Resources provides an amount of disposable income available to you each month. Each month your disposable income resets; it cannot be “banked” and accumulated from month to month. However, you may pool Resources with other characters or pay for things that cost more than your Resources allotment of money by spending on a month-to-month basis.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> You are comfortably in the middle class. You can afford a decent house or apartment, pay for a nice car, and consistently count on $2,500 in disposable income monthly.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> You are in the upper class, with a fancy new car and a large suburban home or an upscale condo in the heart of the city. You have $20,000 each month for disposable income.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> You are rich. You probably live in an elaborate mansion or a penthouse atop one of the city’s most desirable buildings, and you can afford multiple luxury cars and other finery. Each month, you have $100,000 in disposable income.</li>

For example, Tremere use hermetic sigils, while Banu Haqim use gematria. When the trespasser touches the warded object, a supernatural force of energy that feels much like an electric shock burns through the trespasser''s body. Wielding warded items and striking trespassers does not trigger the effects of the ward. Similarly, Attacking or using a Combat Maneuver against someone who has warded armor does not trigger the ward. However, if the trespasser were to disarm a combatant of a warded sword, then tried to pick it up, this would trigger the ward.</p><p>Wards can only cover objects no larger than three square feet or an area that would take only one step to cross. You could not ward an entire door, for example, but you could ward the door handle. The caster pours one Rouse check worth of blood, mixed with any required ingredients, on the object and traces the glyph with her bare finger. Once the casting time is complete, she may wipe away the Blood, rendering the ward invisible to mundane senses. Sense the Unseen can detect a ward if the Auspex user wins a contest challenge using her Wits + Awareness vs. the Ritual caster’s Intelligence + Occult. The ward lasts until the object is physically destroyed. Most objects that are warded only have one Structure, but particularly rugged items may have more. A character may only maintain a number of wards equal to twice her dots in the Occult Skill. If she creates a new ward in excess of her limit, the first (chronologically) ward she created ceases to function permanently.</p><p>When a trespasser touches a ward (gloves or other garments offer no protection), she immediately takes one point of Aggravated Damage and must immediately release the object unless she activates a power such as Uncanny Grip, which protects her from being disarmed. She must then make a test to avoid Terror Frenzy, with a difficulty equal to the caster’s dots in the Occult Skill. Further attempts by the trespasser to touch the object require a Stamina + Resolve (difficulty 5) challenge before being able to. Successful contact again causes one Aggravated Damage, but does not risk sending the trespasser into a Terror Frenzy. If the trespasser is a creature that does not normally Frenzy, she still makes this test and, if they fail, must flee, directly away from the warded object for five minutes.</p>\"}","{\"label\":\"Warding Circles\",\"text\":\"<p>Warding circles are similar to wards but are much larger and are painted on the ground or floor. Trespassers who attempt to cross the boundary of a warding circle suffer the same effects as if they had touched a warded object. Instead of letting go of the warded object, they instead cease their movement at the warding circle''s boundary. Should the trespasser wish, and presuming she has not succumbed to a Terror Frenzy, she may attempt to cross the boundary again by making a successful Stamina + Resolve (difficulty 7). Each subsequent attempt to cross the boundary (successful or not) of a warding circle results in one point of Aggravated Damage but does not cause the trespasser to risk Frenzy. Once inside a warding circle, leaving its boundaries causes no ill effect.</p><p>A ritualist may choose to inscribe a warding circle pointing inward around a trespasser (who has likely been incapacitated prior to the casting of the warding circle). In this case entering into the circle causes no ill effect but any trespassers trying to leave the circle suffer the effects of the ward.</p><p><strong>Warding circles differ from wards in the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li>A warding circle requires three Rouse checks to cast. If any of these cause the vampire to Frenzy, the ward cannot be completed.</li>       <li>Warding circles are considered enclosed columns with a radius up to 18 feet (six steps of movement). Warding circles cast indoors extend from floor to ceiling. Warding circles cast outdoors extend from ground level to 18 feet (six steps of movement).</li>        <li>A warding circle exists only on the plane of existence it was cast in. However, creatures attempting to circumnavigate a warding circle by crossing into (or out of) it from one realm are blocked in the same way as if they had encountered the border of the warding circle. In addition to the normal costs, creatures must repay any cost to cross the boundary between worlds on each subsequent attempt to bypass the warding circle in this way.</li><li>Unlike normal wards, a warding circle can activate with forcible contact.</li><li>Warding circles cost three Rouse checks worth of Blood to paint the necessary sigils and one full night to cast. This does not cost a Downtime Action.</li>  <li>Warding circles last for a year and a day after casting. Once in place, nothing short of complete removal of all solid material 18 feet below the surface of the warding circle will end a warding circle early.</li>        <li>A character may only maintain a number of warding circles equal to her Occult Skill.

For the purposes of this power, inanimate corpses (including the corpses of supernatural creatures and the remains of destroyed vampires) count as objects and may be targeted by Spirit’s Touch. Vampires who have not met Final Death do not count as corpses.</p>

<p>Spend a standard action, make one Rouse check, and touch an object. To collect a psychic impression, touch the target with your bare skin. You then enter a shallow trance and glean information from the spiritual residue on the object. You are only marginally aware of your surroundings while using Spirit’s Touch, although a loud noise or jarring physical sensation will break the trance in an instant. Spirit’s Touch works in the following three ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the object is a corpse, your character receives a vision of the last few moments of the target’s life, including the killer''s face if the victim saw her. If the killer was using supernatural means (such as Mask of a Thousand Faces) to hide their true identity, Spirit’s Touch reveals the fake visage, not the true face.</li>
    <li>If the object is not a corpse, you can determine the last person that handled the object (not including yourself).</li>
    <li>If the object is not a corpse, you can discover the most memorable event concerning the object. This may be its creation, its use in a murder, etc. Merely being present for a memorable event does not reveal anything; the object must have been involved in the event to “remember” it.</li>
</ul>

<p>To discover additional interactions, such as an older handler of an item, or another memorable event, you must succeed in a Intelligence + Investigation challenge vs. a difficulty of 3 while maintaining your hold on the item. These challenges do not cost additional actions or Rouse checks. This difficulty increases by one for each additional interaction trying to be discovered. Once you have failed one of these tests, you may not test again for an hour.</p>

<p>These images come from a 360-degree point of view, extending outward, from the object or corpse. Regardless of whether the object is a corpse, you also sense any deep emotions relevant to the psychic images you received. The visions received by the use of this power are seldom clear or detailed; they register more like a “psychic snapshot.” They are visual only and lack any sounds, smell, or tactile stimuli. Still, a clever vampire can learn a great deal from a glimpse.</p>

<p>Unlike people, objects do not have a mind that can be fooled by Obfuscate. When using Spirit’s Touch on an object (not a corpse), powers such as Unseen Passage and Mask of a Thousand Faces do not obscure interactions with objects. The true visage of characters employing these powers is left behind, unless the character is using the Obfuscate power Soul Mask or the Oblivion Ceremony Alone in the Dark. Unless a character touches an item using one of these two powers, the psychic impression she leaves is always of her true self, even if disguised in other ways.</p>

This power will not work on blind subjects or subjects who cannot see your eyes. Your target must be a non-supernatural mortal or a ghoul who is three steps Blood Bound to you. Make a Rouse check, and make an opposed challenge. If successful, your consciousness is transferred into the target’s body, and her mind is rendered into a fugue-like state.</p>

<p>While using Possession, your character’s mind is focused entirely on controlling the body she has inhabited. The vampire has no innate sense of anything occurring to her native physical form. The character’s original body falls into a temporary torpor that lasts the duration of the power. If the possessing vampire''s body takes any amount of damage, Possession ends immediately, and the vampire awakens.</p>

<p>While possessing a mortal, the controlling vampire may use any Auspex, Presence, and Dominate powers she knows through the mortal. If possessing a ghoul, she may also use any Potence, Celerity, Fortitude, or Protean powers the ghoul may have. In both instances, Amalgams are eligible to be used as long as the second Discipline is also one of the eligible Disciplines to be used during Possession. The vampire maintains her attributes and Skills, both mental and social, but she must use the possessed body’s physical attributes and Skills.</p>

<p>A vampire using Possession must still Rouse her Blood to empower any Disciplines she may access. However, she may not Rouse the Blood for any other purposes. In addition, she is still susceptible to Frenzy while possessing the mortal. If the host body takes Aggravated Damage, the controlling vampire must make a static challenge using her Resolve + Intimidation vs. a difficulty of 3 + the damage taken to stay in control of the body.

Either use requires a standard action and a Rouse check. If the target is mortal or willing, no challenge is required. If they are not mortal and are unwilling, make a contested challenge.</p>

<p>Communicating telepathically allows the character and her target to send and receive mental messages and simple images. You may use this mode of Telepathy on any character you have met who is within your local area of play. Line of sight is not required. When communicating with a willing target, a single use of Telepathy lasts for an hour and allows the characters to communicate freely. This mode of Telepathy may be extended by another hour for one Rouse check. A character can maintain Telepathic links to a number of willing characters equal to her dots in Composure.

<p>If a willing character becomes unwilling during a telepathic session, the character using Telepathy must immediately succeed in an opposed challenge using the Telepathy test pool or be ejected from the now-unwilling character’s mind. A character may also choose to become willing at any point during the resolution of Telepathy.</p>

<p>Alternatively, your character may pull one image or specific piece of information out of the mind of an unwilling target within line of sight. The information you gain in this way must truthfully answer one of the following questions (your choice):</p>
