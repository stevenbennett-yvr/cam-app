For example, Tremere use hermetic sigils, while Banu Haqim use gematria. When the trespasser touches the warded object, a supernatural force of energy that feels much like an electric shock burns through the trespasser''s body. Wielding warded items and striking trespassers does not trigger the effects of the ward. Similarly, Attacking or using a Combat Maneuver against someone who has warded armor does not trigger the ward. However, if the trespasser were to disarm a combatant of a warded sword, then tried to pick it up, this would trigger the ward.</p><p>Wards can only cover objects no larger than three square feet or an area that would take only one step to cross. You could not ward an entire door, for example, but you could ward the door handle. The caster pours one Rouse check worth of blood, mixed with any required ingredients, on the object and traces the glyph with her bare finger. Once the casting time is complete, she may wipe away the Blood, rendering the ward invisible to mundane senses. Sense the Unseen can detect a ward if the Auspex user wins a contest challenge using her Wits + Awareness vs. the Ritual caster’s Intelligence + Occult. The ward lasts until the object is physically destroyed. Most objects that are warded only have one Structure, but particularly rugged items may have more. A character may only maintain a number of wards equal to twice her dots in the Occult Skill. If she creates a new ward in excess of her limit, the first (chronologically) ward she created ceases to function permanently.</p><p>When a trespasser touches a ward (gloves or other garments offer no protection), she immediately takes one point of Aggravated Damage and must immediately release the object unless she activates a power such as Uncanny Grip, which protects her from being disarmed. She must then make a test to avoid Terror Frenzy, with a difficulty equal to the caster’s dots in the Occult Skill. Further attempts by the trespasser to touch the object require a Stamina + Resolve (difficulty 5) challenge before being able to. Successful contact again causes one Aggravated Damage, but does not risk sending the trespasser into a Terror Frenzy. If the trespasser is a creature that does not normally Frenzy, she still makes this test and, if they fail, must flee, directly away from the warded object for five minutes.</p>\"}","{\"label\":\"Warding Circles\",\"text\":\"<p>Warding circles are similar to wards but are much larger and are painted on the ground or floor. Trespassers who attempt to cross the boundary of a warding circle suffer the same effects as if they had touched a warded object. Instead of letting go of the warded object, they instead cease their movement at the warding circle''s boundary. Should the trespasser wish, and presuming she has not succumbed to a Terror Frenzy, she may attempt to cross the boundary again by making a successful Stamina + Resolve (difficulty 7). Each subsequent attempt to cross the boundary (successful or not) of a warding circle results in one point of Aggravated Damage but does not cause the trespasser to risk Frenzy. Once inside a warding circle, leaving its boundaries causes no ill effect.</p><p>A ritualist may choose to inscribe a warding circle pointing inward around a trespasser (who has likely been incapacitated prior to the casting of the warding circle). In this case entering into the circle causes no ill effect but any trespassers trying to leave the circle suffer the effects of the ward.</p><p><strong>Warding circles differ from wards in the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li>A warding circle requires three Rouse checks to cast. If any of these cause the vampire to Frenzy, the ward cannot be completed.</li>       <li>Warding circles are considered enclosed columns with a radius up to 18 feet (six steps of movement). Warding circles cast indoors extend from floor to ceiling. Warding circles cast outdoors extend from ground level to 18 feet (six steps of movement).</li>        <li>A warding circle exists only on the plane of existence it was cast in. However, creatures attempting to circumnavigate a warding circle by crossing into (or out of) it from one realm are blocked in the same way as if they had encountered the border of the warding circle. In addition to the normal costs, creatures must repay any cost to cross the boundary between worlds on each subsequent attempt to bypass the warding circle in this way.</li><li>Unlike normal wards, a warding circle can activate with forcible contact.</li><li>Warding circles cost three Rouse checks worth of Blood to paint the necessary sigils and one full night to cast. This does not cost a Downtime Action.</li>  <li>Warding circles last for a year and a day after casting. Once in place, nothing short of complete removal of all solid material 18 feet below the surface of the warding circle will end a warding circle early.</li>        <li>A character may only maintain a number of warding circles equal to her Occult Skill.

<p>Spend a standard action, make one Rouse check, and touch an object. To collect a psychic impression, touch the target with your bare skin. You then enter a shallow trance and glean information from the spiritual residue on the object. You are only marginally aware of your surroundings while using Spirit’s Touch, although a loud noise or jarring physical sensation will break the trance in an instant. Spirit’s Touch works in the following three ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the object is a corpse, your character receives a vision of the last few moments of the target’s life, including the killer''s face if the victim saw her. If the killer was using supernatural means (such as Mask of a Thousand Faces) to hide their true identity, Spirit’s Touch reveals the fake visage, not the true face.</li>
    <li>If the object is not a corpse, you can determine the last person that handled the object (not including yourself).</li>
    <li>If the object is not a corpse, you can discover the most memorable event concerning the object. This may be its creation, its use in a murder, etc. Merely being present for a memorable event does not reveal anything; the object must have been involved in the event to “remember” it.</li>
</ul>

<p>To discover additional interactions, such as an older handler of an item, or another memorable event, you must succeed in a Intelligence + Investigation challenge vs. a difficulty of 3 while maintaining your hold on the item. These challenges do not cost additional actions or Rouse checks. This difficulty increases by one for each additional interaction trying to be discovered.

<p>These images come from a 360-degree point of view, extending outward, from the object or corpse. Regardless of whether the object is a corpse, you also sense any deep emotions relevant to the psychic images you received. The visions received by the use of this power are seldom clear or detailed; they register more like a “psychic snapshot.” They are visual only and lack any sounds, smell, or tactile stimuli. Still, a clever vampire can learn a great deal from a glimpse.</p>

<p>Unlike people, objects do not have a mind that can be fooled by Obfuscate.

<p>While using Possession, your character’s mind is focused entirely on controlling the body she has inhabited. The vampire has no innate sense of anything occurring to her native physical form. The character’s original body falls into a temporary torpor that lasts the duration of the power. If the possessing vampire''s body takes any amount of damage, Possession ends immediately, and the vampire awakens.</p>

<p>While possessing a mortal, the controlling vampire may use any Auspex, Presence, and Dominate powers she knows through the mortal.

<p>Communicating telepathically allows the character and her target to send and receive mental messages and simple images. You may use this mode of Telepathy on any character you have met who is within your local area of play. Line of sight is not required. When communicating with a willing target, a single use of Telepathy lasts for an hour and allows the characters to communicate freely.
